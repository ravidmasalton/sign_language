![Word to Animation](/public/image_screen/Word%20to%20Animation.png)

The Word to Animation feature allows users to search for specific words or phrases and view the corresponding sign language animations. This is an essential tool for learning sign language, with high-quality animations and playback controls.

### Video Upload & Contribution
![Video Upload](/public/image_screen/Video%20Upload.png)

The Video Upload screen allows users to contribute to the sign language dataset by recording and uploading their own sign language videos. This helps expand the dataset and improve the machine learning model's accuracy over time.

## Detailed Feature Descriptions

### Home Screen

The Home Screen is designed with user experience in mind, featuring:

- **Modern Interface**: A clean, visually appealing design with intuitive navigation
- **Quick Access Tiles**: Large, easy-to-tap tiles for accessing main features
- **Gradient Background**: Soothing purple gradient that provides visual appeal
- **Animated Elements**: Subtle animations that enhance the user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes

The home screen establishes the application's design language with its gradient backgrounds, floating cards, and accessibility-focused UI elements. Users can quickly access Sign Language Recognition, Word to Animation, Video Upload, and Settings from this central hub. The modern, minimalist design ensures that users can navigate to their desired feature without confusion.

### Sign Language Recognition (Video to Word)

The Sign Language Recognition screen transforms sign language into text through:

- **Real-time Camera Feed**: Shows user's gestures with overlay of detected keypoints
- **Live Recognition**: Displays recognized signs with confidence percentages
- **Accumulated Text**: Builds sentences from recognized signs
- **Adjustable Settings**: Controls for detection sensitivity and other parameters
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Color-coded confidence indicators and smooth animations

This feature utilizes MediaPipe Holistic to extract 225-dimensional keypoint vectors from the user's hands, face, and pose. These keypoints are processed through a TensorFlow.js model that predicts the sign being performed. The system is designed to work in various lighting conditions and can recognize a vocabulary of 30 common signs. As users perform signs, the system displays the detected sign along with a confidence score, and allows building sentences by accumulating recognized words.

### Sign Language Learning (Word to Animation)

The Word to Animation screen facilitates learning through:

- **Word Search**: Input field to find specific words or phrases
- **High-quality Animations**: Clear, professional sign language demonstrations
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, slow-motion, and loop options
- **Voice Input**: Option to speak words for signing demonstration
- **Sequence Mode**: Create and play sequences of signs to form sentences

This feature serves as a learning tool for those wanting to learn sign language. Users can type a word or use voice input to search for signs. The application then displays high-quality video animations demonstrating the correct sign. Users can play, pause, and replay the animations as needed. The sequence mode allows users to create sentences by chaining multiple signs together, which is particularly useful for learning conversational sign language. The clean interface ensures that users can focus on the animations without distraction.

### Video Upload & Contribution

The Video Upload screen empowers users to contribute through:

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easy upload of sign language videos
- **Metadata Form**: Fields for categorizing and describing the uploaded sign
- **Preview Functionality**: Review uploaded content before processing
- **Processing Status**: Visual indicators of upload and processing progress
- **Contribution History**: Record of previous uploads and their impact

This collaborative feature allows the community to contribute to the sign language dataset, which in turn improves the model's recognition capabilities. Users can upload videos of themselves performing signs, specify the gesture name and contributor information, and preview the video before submission. The system processes these videos to extract keypoints using MediaPipe Holistic, which are then stored for potential model retraining. Progress indicators keep users informed throughout the upload and processing stages, creating a transparent and engaging contribution experience.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The application is built with a modern tech stack:

</p>

- **Frontend**: React.js with functional components and hooks
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage for videos and extracted features
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js for in-browser inference
- **Video Processing**: MediaPipe Holistic for feature extraction
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS with styled-components

### Machine Learning Pipeline

The sign language recognition system follows this pipeline:

1. **Input**: Camera feed or uploaded video
2. **Feature Extraction**: MediaPipe Holistic extracts 225-dimensional keypoint vectors (face, pose, hand landmarks)
3. **Preprocessing**: Normalization and formatting of keypoint data
4. **Model Inference**: Custom-trained TensorFlow.js model predicts sign class
5. **Post-processing**: Converting predictions to text with confidence scores

The model is trained using a custom dataset of sign language gestures, with multiple examples per sign class to ensure robustness. The model achieves approximately 85% accuracy on the test dataset, with better performance on signs with distinct hand shapes and movements.

## Video Upload Feature

The video upload feature allows users to:
1. Upload MP4 videos of sign language gestures
2. Provide metadata (gesture name, contributor)
3. Process videos to extract 225-dimensional keypoints (pose + hands)
4. Store both the original video and the extracted keypoints

Uploaded videos are saved to `/public/uploads/<gesture>/` and processed keypoints are stored in `/processed_keypoints/<gesture>/<video_id>/keypoints.npy`.
